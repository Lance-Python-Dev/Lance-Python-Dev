Hey there! 

I’m Lance, a Data Engineer based in Nigeria.

Asides Data Engineering, these are the fields I'm Interested in, and have the skils to work in: 
- Prompt Engineering
- AI/Workflow Operations
- AI Software Engineering

  also, an other fields that use AI and exposed to a lot of LLMs(Large Language Models)

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is Python, and I have basic proficiency in JavaScript and C#. My favorite tools are VS Code, n8n.
I work with a lot of AI tools for my projects eg. Claude's Sonnet, Chatgpt's OpenAI, Gemini, v0.dev

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorites is the Mini DataLake House & My first AI Workflow.

Thank you for reading to the end. You could view a few of my projects too!
